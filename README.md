Super-Zhot
==========

I had some fun teaching myself Perl with my Rock-Paper-Scissors script over at 
https://bitbucket.org/AmyDeeDempster/rock-paper-scissors

This is a more extensible version in Python, done in a more mathematical
and object-oriented manner.

Supply a Comma-Separated Values file as a command-line argument for this script.

In the game, type the name of the move you wish to play. 
This can be abbreviated.

Other commands available include:
* rules
* score
* rounds
* exit

You can also just hit Return to quit the game.
